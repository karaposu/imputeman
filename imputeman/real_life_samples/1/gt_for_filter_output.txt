Looking at the original HTML, there are 2 main voltage specifications for this diode:
Complete Voltage Information (Should be captured):

Reverse Voltage (VR): V<sub>R</sub> ≤ 100 V
Forward Voltage (VF): V<sub>F</sub> [max] (mV): 1000@IF=50mA

What Each Strategy Actually Got:
StrategyReverse Voltage (VR)Forward Voltage (VF)ContextLiberal ✅✅ Got it✅ Got it✅ Full table structureContextual ❌✅ Got it❌ MISSED IT❌ Fragmented pieces
The Problem with Contextual Strategy:
❌ Missing Forward Voltage Completely
The contextual strategy missed this entire voltage specification:
html<th>V<sub>F</sub> [max] (mV)</th>
<td>1000@IF=50mA</td>
❌ Lost Table Context
Instead of getting the full parametrics table showing both voltage specs together, it gave you 3 disconnected fragments:

Fragment 1: Reverse voltage alone
Fragment 2: Just VR max value
Fragment 3: Duplicate reverse voltage

✅ What Liberal Strategy Got Right

Both voltage specifications (VR + VF)
Complete table structure showing how they relate
Single coherent section with all voltage info together

For Your "All Information About Voltage" Spec:
You should get:

Reverse voltage: VR ≤ 100 V
Forward voltage: VF = 1000 mV @ IF=50mA
The complete parametrics context

Contextual gave you 60% of voltage info, Liberal gave you 100%.
That's exactly what I meant by "loses the full parametrics table" - it missed the forward voltage specification entirely and fragmented what it did find! 🎯
